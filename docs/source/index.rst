============================================

I am a researcher with the `Center for Marine Autonomy and Robotics <https://marinerobotics.centers.vt.edu/>`__ at Virginia Tech, and I work under the supervision of `Dr. Dan Stilwell <https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/stilwell.html>`__.

I completed an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2018. 
In my `thesis <https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/84915>`__ I derived a novel dynamic model for the `Dragon <https://marinerobotics.centers.vt.edu/robots-systems-facilities/690auv1.html>`__ autonmous underwater vehicle (AUV) coupled with its payload. 

I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering with a research focus on collaborative subsea mapping. In particular, I seek to develop coordination strategies that optimize a rigorous measure of mission performance while requiring minimal communication.
